# Project Overview
This project leverages Machine Learning algorithms to predict credit risk scores, utilizing a dataset of 700 individuals. The primary objective is to enhance the accuracy of credit risk assessments, aiding financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

# Dataset
Source: Kaggle - [Credit Risk Analysis for Extending Bank Loans](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atulmittal199174/credit-risk-analysis-for-extending-bank-loans)

| Model                    | Accuracy (%)  |
| ------------------------ | ------------- |
| Random Forest Classifier |       79      |
| Support Vector Machine   |       82      |
| Linear Regression        |       84      |

# Tools and Techniques
Data Preparation and Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
Data Visualization: Matplotlib
Data Split: 80-20 ratio (training-testing)
Implemented cross-validation for more robust model evaluation.
Model Optimization: Pre-trial runs were conducted to fine-tune model parameters, resulting in improved accuracy in the final predictions.

# Future Work
Explore additional models to further improve accuracy.
Expand the dataset to include more diverse demographic data for better generalization.
